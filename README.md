This is a new version of Botwell, for Joshua Bardwell's discord server.

Botwell was originally created by a user named Puck, and was a bot that allows you to search for videos on Joshua Bardwell's youtube channel.

This version is a revival of the original Botwell since we lost touch with Puck and had none of the original code.

This is a project by itsblunty, and is a project to learn Python and discord.py.

Botwell has quite a few features, including:
- Searching for videos on Joshua Bardwell's youtube channel
- Caching messages to a file, so that we can log deleted messages.
- A feedback command, that allows you to send feedback to the developers.
- A help command, that shows all the commands and their descriptions.
